	   This document is written by the Great Dohyun, a.k.a. Dohyun Nam. It contains the instructions for Ti-89 Titanium, which is a graphing calculator that has tons of functions provided. Also, this document is the first project of Dohyun, so there can be a lot of unnecessary information or vacant sections left to be filled out. I hope this project is worth the time, for improving my English writing skills, getting to know better about my calculator and making documents with \LaTeX
